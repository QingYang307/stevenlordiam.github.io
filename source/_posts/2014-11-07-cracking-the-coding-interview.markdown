I start to write code for the book **Cracking the Coding Interview** today, and I will post my code to [my Github page](https://github.com/stevenlordiam/CC150) daily to keep track. You are welcomed to fork.

I implement the programs in Java language, and after I finish all the code, I will provide Python and C++ implement.
